			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>My name is Batu 🦾 and I am a software engineer. I am going to graduate from the University of Alberta in May 2023. I am passionate about AI/ML, Distributed and Parallel systems and Backend engineering. Always looking out for information and learning new technologies. I love implementing the new technologies I learn as impactful projects that make people's lives easier and more enjoyable. I have experience developing ML models, web applications, APIs, mobile apps, and desktop software. 👨🏽‍💻</p>
            <p>As for my hobbies outside of tech, I love hiking 🥾, watching movies 🍿 and traveling 🛫. I enjoy learning about cultures from all around the world 🌎. My favorite places I have ever been are Istanbul, Amsterdam, and Rome. I also have an impressive collection of "For Dummies" books📚 and am on my journey to find the world's finest poutine.</p>
