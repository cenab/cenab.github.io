  <h1>about</h1>
  <p>
    I build software that stays practical under real constraints. I care about clear defaults, small
    surfaces, and shipping things that help people move faster without breaking trust.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most days I work on systems, security-minded development, and teams that want a clean path from
    idea to deployment.
